   This project uses machine learning models to classify songs into two genres: Rock and Hip-Hop. It preprocesses the data, trains decision tree and logistic regression models, evaluates their performance, and performs cross-validation.

2. How to Run the Script:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer.
   - Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the script 'main.py' using the command: python main.py

3. Requirements:
   - Python 3.7 or later
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn

4. Additional Information:
   - The 'datasets' folder contains the necessary data files ('fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv' and 'echonest-metrics.json').
   - The 'audio_genre_classifier.py' file contains the implementation of the classification tasks.
   - The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the script.
